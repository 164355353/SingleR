\title{Calculate single-sample gene set enrichment (ssGSEA) for each single cell}
\usage{
calculateSignatures(sc_data, species = "Human", signatures = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sc_data}{the single-cell RNA-seq data set as a matrix with genes as rownames. If the data if from a full-length platform, counts must be normalized to gene length (TPM, RPKM, FPKM, etc.).}

\item{species}{(\code{"Mouse"} or \code{"Human"})}

\item{signatures}{a GeneSetCollection oject, or NULL to use default signatures}
}
\value{
scores for each signature and single cell
}
