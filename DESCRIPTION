Author: Dvir Aran
Maintainer: Dvir Aran <dvir.aran@ucsf.edu>
Description: A computational method for unbiased cell type recognition of scRNA-seq. SingleR leverages reference transcriptomic datasets of pure cell types to infer the cell of origin of each of the single cells independently. SingleRâ€™s annotations combined with Seurat, a processing and analysis package designed for scRNA-seq, provide a powerful tool for the investigation of scRNA-seq data
